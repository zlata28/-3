    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h3>ACT 1</h3>
    <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
</header>
<main>Two households,both alike in dignity,<br>
    In fair Verona,wherewe lay our scene,<br>
    From fncient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
    A pair of stal-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
    Do winh their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
    The Which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
